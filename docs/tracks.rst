Tracks, maps & the Frenet frame
================================

Every :class:`~f1tenth_gym.envs.f110_env.F110Env` runs on a :class:`~f1tenth_gym.envs.track.track.Track`: an occupancy map for LiDAR/wall-collision plus one or two reference lines (a *centerline* and a *raceline*). This page explains how a track is resolved from ``map_name``, the map file convention, how to build a synthetic track from scratch, the difference between the centerline and the raceline, and the Frenet ``(s, ey, ephi)`` frame that the simulator reports.

The track is selected by :class:`~f1tenth_gym.envs.env_config.EnvConfig`'s ``map_name`` field (default ``"Spielberg"``). See :doc:`configuration` for the full config tree and :doc:`quickstart` for a first run.

How a map is resolved
---------------------

``map_name`` may be a built-in name, a path, or a live ``Track`` instance. ``F110Env._resolve_track`` dispatches on the value:

- **A bare name** (no path separators, no file suffix), e.g. ``"Spielberg"`` — resolved with :meth:`Track.from_track_name <f1tenth_gym.envs.track.track.Track.from_track_name>`, which looks the map up under the repo-root ``maps/`` directory and **downloads it if missing**.
- **A path** (contains ``/`` or ``\`` or a file suffix) — resolved with :meth:`Track.from_track_path <f1tenth_gym.envs.track.track.Track.from_track_path>` against a local track directory you provide.
- **A ``Track`` instance** — used as-is, no I/O. This is how you feed a synthetic or programmatically built track (see `Synthetic tracks`_ below).

Built-in tracks and the download
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bundled ``maps/`` directory is **git-ignored** (only ``maps/.gitkeep`` is tracked). The first time a built-in track is requested, ``find_track_dir`` fetches it from a hard-coded endpoint::

    https://api.f1tenth.org/<name>.tar.xz

and extracts it into the repo-root ``maps/`` folder (resolved by walking up from the source file, so this only works for an **editable / from-source install**). Extraction uses ``filter="data"`` (tar hardening); there is no checksum verification.

.. code-block:: python

    import gymnasium as gym
    from f1tenth_gym.envs.env_config import EnvConfig, SimulationConfig

    cfg = EnvConfig(
        map_name="Spielberg",                                # downloaded on first use
        simulation_config=SimulationConfig(max_laps=None),   # else the episode ends after 1 lap
        render_enabled=False,
    )
    env = gym.make("f1tenth_gym:f1tenth-v0", config=cfg)
    obs, info = env.reset(seed=42)
    env.close()

.. note::

   The download needs network access and a writable, source-checkout ``maps/`` directory. A missing map raises ``FileNotFoundError("No maps exists for <name>.")`` on a 404. Other F1TENTH track names on the endpoint (for example ``"Monza"``, ``"Levine"``) resolve the same way.

The map file convention
-----------------------

A track directory holds a **ROS-style occupancy map**: a YAML metadata file next to a single-channel image, plus optional reference-line CSVs. ``from_track_name`` tries ``{stem}.yaml`` first, then falls back to the legacy ``{stem}_map.yaml``. The YAML (:class:`~f1tenth_gym.envs.track.track.TrackSpec`) carries ``image``, ``resolution``, ``origin``, ``negate``, ``occupied_thresh`` and ``free_thresh``.

The metadata drives the simulator as follows:

- **resolution** — metres per pixel (multiplied by ``EnvConfig.map_scale``).
- **origin** — the world coordinate of the map's **bottom-left corner**; only ``origin[0]`` and ``origin[1]`` are used (the ``origin[2]`` rotation is ignored). ``origin[:2]`` is scaled by ``map_scale``.
- **image** — the occupancy image, loaded ``FLIP_TOP_BOTTOM`` so that grid row 0 is the smallest world ``y``.
- **negate**, **occupied_thresh** — control the binarisation, ROS ``map_server`` style (below). ``free_thresh`` is accepted but has no separate effect: the "unknown" band it would delimit is treated as free.

The image is binarised following ROS ``map_server`` semantics. Occupancy probability is
``(255 - pixel) / 255``, or ``pixel / 255`` when ``negate: 1``, and a cell is an obstacle exactly
when that probability exceeds ``occupied_thresh``; everything else — including the ROS "unknown"
band — is free, because the ray tracer needs a binary world. In the resulting grid ``0`` is
occupied and ``255`` is free; dark pixels are walls, and the LiDAR's distance transform measures
the distance to the nearest zero. Releases before v1.0.0 ignored the YAML and cut at a hard-coded
pixel value of 128; set ``occupied_thresh: 0.495`` to reproduce that grid exactly.

Reference-line CSVs are optional and looked up by name in the track directory: ``{name}_centerline.csv`` (columns ``x_m, y_m, ...``, comma-delimited) and ``{name}_raceline.csv`` (columns ``s_m; x_m; y_m; psi_rad; kappa_radpm; vx_mps; ax_mps2``, semicolon-delimited).

.. warning::

   ``from_track_name`` sets ``centerline=None`` when ``{name}_centerline.csv`` is absent, and — unlike ``from_track_path`` — it does **not** fall back to the raceline. A track directory that ships only a raceline CSV leaves ``track.centerline is None``, and the first ``reset()`` then raises ``AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'spline'`` because the Frenet transform reads the centerline. Provide a centerline CSV (or supply the ``Track`` yourself with ``centerline`` set) for custom tracks.

Custom track directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Point ``map_name`` at a path (with a separator or a file suffix) to load your own map with the same ROS convention:

.. code-block:: python

    from f1tenth_gym.envs.env_config import EnvConfig

    cfg = EnvConfig(map_name="/abs/path/to/mytrack/mytrack.yaml", render_enabled=False)
    # F110Env resolves this via Track.from_track_path

Centerline vs. raceline
-----------------------

A :class:`~f1tenth_gym.envs.track.track.Track` carries two :class:`~f1tenth_gym.envs.track.raceline.Raceline` objects, each backed by a periodic cubic spline over ``[x, y, cos ψ, sin ψ, k, vx, ax]``:

- ``track.centerline`` — the geometric middle of the track. When built from a bare centerline CSV via ``from_centerline_file``, its speed profile is a **constant ``1.0`` m/s** (``fixed_speed=1.0`` is hard-coded), so ``centerline.vxs`` is *not* a usable racing speed profile.
- ``track.raceline`` — the optimized racing line, carrying a real speed profile ``raceline.vxs``.

Which one matters depends on the subsystem:

- **Reset / spawning** — every ``RL_*`` reset strategy binds to ``track.raceline`` (never the centerline). See :doc:`reproducibility` and the reset section of :doc:`configuration`. Cars spawn *on the raceline*.
- **Frenet frame** — the simulator's reported ``(s, ey, ephi)`` is always computed against the **centerline** (see below).

.. warning::

   Cars spawn on the raceline but Frenet is measured against the centerline, so ``ey`` is **non-zero at spawn** — about 0.8 m on Spielberg. This is expected, not a bug in your code; subtract the spawn ``ey`` if you need a zero baseline.

   Lap counting is unaffected. The two loops are different lengths (Spielberg: centerline 343.3 m, raceline 338.1 m), but both sides of the lap arithmetic are denominated in centerline arclength, so one physical lap measures exactly one lap whatever line the car drives. What the length difference does change is ``info["progress"]`` and the PROGRESS reward, which accrue ~343.3 m per lap rather than the ~338.1 m the car actually travels — deliberate, so that a longer racing line is not paid more.

The Frenet frame ``(s, ey, ephi)``
----------------------------------

When ``SimulationConfig.compute_frenet_frame`` is ``True`` (the default), each step reports a per-agent Frenet pose in the observation as ``frenet_pose`` (a 3-vector ``(s, ey, ephi)``; see :doc:`observations`). Units are metres, metres, radians:

- **s** — arclength progress along the **centerline** spline, wrapped into ``[0, s_frame_max)``.
- **ey** — signed lateral deviation from the centerline. **``+ey`` is to the LEFT** of the direction of travel (the sign comes from the spline normal ``[-sin ψ, cos ψ]``).
- **ephi** — heading deviation ``psi - yaw_of_centerline``, wrapped to ``[-π, π)``.

.. note::

   The Frenet frame is **always centerline-based** — ``cartesian_to_frenet`` and ``frenet_to_cartesian`` default to ``use_raceline=False`` and both simulator call sites use that default. There is no config knob to measure Frenet against the raceline.

Converting coordinates directly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can transform points yourself on any ``Track``:

.. code-block:: python

    from f1tenth_gym.envs.track.track import Track

    track = Track.from_track_name("Spielberg")

    # Cartesian -> Frenet: returns (s, ey, ephi)
    s, ey, ephi = track.cartesian_to_frenet(x=0.0, y=0.0, psi=0.0)

    # Frenet -> Cartesian: returns (x, y, psi)
    x, y, psi = track.frenet_to_cartesian(s=s, ey=ey, ephi=ephi)

Pass ``use_raceline=True`` to either method to measure against the raceline instead of the centerline.

Synthetic tracks
----------------

To race on a shape with no map file, build a :class:`~f1tenth_gym.envs.track.track.Track` from a reference line and pass the **instance** as ``map_name``. :meth:`Track.from_refline <f1tenth_gym.envs.track.track.Track.from_refline>` takes ``x``, ``y`` and per-waypoint velocity ``velx`` arrays, fits a periodic cubic spline, and synthesizes a free-space occupancy map sized to the extents plus a 5 m margin (both centerline and raceline are set to this same line).

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import gymnasium as gym
    from f1tenth_gym.envs.env_config import EnvConfig, SimulationConfig
    from f1tenth_gym.envs.track.track import Track

    # A closed circle of radius 10 m, target speed 5 m/s everywhere
    theta = np.linspace(0.0, 2.0 * np.pi, 200, endpoint=False)
    x = 10.0 * np.cos(theta)
    y = 10.0 * np.sin(theta)
    velx = np.full_like(x, 5.0)

    track = Track.from_refline(x=x, y=y, velx=velx)

    cfg = EnvConfig(
        map_name=track,                                      # pass the Track instance directly
        simulation_config=SimulationConfig(max_laps=None),
        render_enabled=False,
    )
    env = gym.make("f1tenth_gym:f1tenth-v0", config=cfg)
    obs, info = env.reset(seed=42)

    for _ in range(50):
        action = np.array([[0.0, 3.0]], dtype=np.float32)    # [[steer, speed]] — steering first
        obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
        if terminated or truncated:
            break
    env.close()

.. warning::

   ``from_refline`` **force-closes the reference line into a loop** — there is no open-path mode. If the last point does not coincide with the first, an extra point is appended to close the loop (required by the periodic spline). A "straight line" input such as ``x=np.linspace(0, 10, N), y=np.zeros(N)`` therefore becomes a closed ~20 m path with a phantom return leg, and ``s``, curvature and lap counting all run over that closed loop. Design your reference line as an intentionally closed circuit.

You can also swap the map on a live env with ``env.unwrapped.update_map(track_or_name)``, or reconfigure via ``env.unwrapped.configure(cfg.with_updates(map_name=...))`` (see :doc:`configuration`).
